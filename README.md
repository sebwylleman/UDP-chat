# UDP-chat

A simple Python Client-Server UDP Chat App for learning Networking Fundamentals.

## Usage

To run this UDP chat app on your local machine, you would open two terminal windows.

- In one, you would start the server by running `python3 udp.py server -p 3000`.
- In the other, you would start the client by running `python3 udp.py client -p 3000`.

The -p 3000 is optional since the code defaults to port 3000 if no port is specified.
